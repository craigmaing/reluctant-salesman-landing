            Terry Mullins never saw himself as a "natural salesperson." In fact, the very idea of selling made him uncomfortable. 
            Yet, despite this reluctance, he consistently outperformed traditional salespeople who relied on scripts and pressure tactics.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            "I couldn't understand why I was being so successful without doing all the complicated things other salespeople seemed to need to do. 
            It wasn't until years later that I realized my 'weakness' was actually my greatest strength."
          </p>
          
          <p>
            This revelation led Terry to develop the Power of Authenticity method - a approach that transforms selling from something you dread 
            into natural conversations that actually work. Now, he helps other reluctant salespeople in financial services discover the same truth: 
            you don't need to change who you are to be successful.
